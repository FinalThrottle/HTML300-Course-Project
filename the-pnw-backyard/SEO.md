SEO Overview

An SEO stands for, Search Engine Optimization. A SEO is basically the exploitation of a search engine algorithm, Google is an example 
of this. A SEO help Google know what's on your page, so that it shows in more results. SEO was an interesting topic to learn about, just 
because throughout the HTML 300, a lot of time has been spent honing skills and buildingwebsites - yet, there was never consideration for 
SEOs or obtaining a high amount of traffic towards the website. Some interesting key
points that I have learned is to reduce the amount of <H1> tags that are meant to be used, more specifically, one <H1> tage per page 
otherwise the amount of SEO will go down. Another interesting subtopic in regards to SEO were 'ghost pages'. The idea of implemented an 
invisible page had never occured to me, however thinking about it, it does make sense. A website designer might make a 'ghost page' that is 
totally unrelated to the content of the website. However, by having a popular topic within that 'ghost page', this may increase the amount 
of SEO the website receives. 

SEO Proposal 

A proposal that I would implement into this course project website is to use tags and words that are related to the content. Rather than
using unrelated wording to draw audiences to the website, I would use things such as "hikes", "trails", "nature", etc., to draw in the
specific audiences and as well include those tags or wordings into something like image alts. Another good thing to implement would be the
location of the website, and where it's based on. I created The PNW Backyard based on Washington's hikes. Althought the word "PNW" is there,
it's not really quite a good indicator of where these hikes may be. The more descriptive the SEO are, the more traffic the website will
gardner from users that are looking for related content.
